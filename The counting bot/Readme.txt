Hey! I Akshat Kumar Prajapati one who made this bot. I made this for BEELATHON Code-challenge.

You can try my bot in 2 ways 

1. First, is just simple if u have your own bot you can try it by pasting your bot token in "token.txt" in place of "your bot token". And run the file "Akśhàť_k_prajapati#9399.py".

2. Second, is adding cog to your bot and running it.

The code is in folder "The Counting Bot".

Please, check my bot

Thank You
Happy Codding
